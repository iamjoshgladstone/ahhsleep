    <h5>What is Ahhsleep?</h5>
    <p>
      Ahhsleep is a sleep aid. It delivers a random set of phrases that evoke
      positive, but non-committal mental imagery. The time between each phrase
      increases throughout your session.
    </p>
    <p>
      This process highlights a concept we've termed <i>Temporal Space</i>. When
      each phrase ends, your brain latches on that imagery. In the silence that
      follows each phrase, the brain starts its process of entering a new stage
      of sleep.
